What does `sc.nextInt()` do?

1. `sc` is the Scanner object:
   - It reads input from `System.in` (keyboard input stream).

2. **`nextInt()` is a method in the Scanner class**:
   - It **reads the next token (chunk of input)** from the input stream and **parses it into an integer**.
   - The token must be a valid integer; otherwise, it throws an exception (`InputMismatchException`).

3. **How it works**:
   - The `Scanner` object scans the input buffer for the next integer and moves the cursor forward after reading it.

Example:
java
Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
int number = sc.nextInt(); // Reads an integer from user input


- If you input `42`, `nextInt()` parses it as the integer `42`.

In Short
- `sc.nextInt()` **reads and converts** the next token in the input to an `int`. 
- If the input isn't an integer, it throws an exception.
